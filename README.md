# transitive_ncaa_champions (FiveThirtyEight Riddler Classic)
Use an R script and data from masseyratings.com to determine how many teams are 2018 transitive-property NCAA men's basketball national champions

The script contains a function that finds the shortest path for a team to the national champion (Villanova) and displays it in the console. In many cases, the path displayed will not be the only one possible, but it will be the shortest one (or tied for the shortest one).

This project is based on FiveThirtyEight's Riddler Classic from April 6, 2018: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-will-the-arithmetic-anarchists-attack/
